How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  Start by generating user stories through interviews. This will allow us as developers to get inside the heads of the users,
  so that we may make relevant changes, as well as a user interface that is easy to understands. This also helps give us a
  starting point for the backlog so we can ensure that we address any and all customer needs. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  Developing programs should be taken peacewise. I plan to apprach a ground up approach and look to make various changes 
  and not make large changes in one go. I think tracking the burndown will help me figure out a time frame for completetion as well.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  A good team member in software development follows the scrum, and is an active participant in the scrum rules. Most importantly, they are
  open to feedback, be it from customers, and team mates. Additionally, being selfaware and open to learn are crucial to success.
